These are the files to create the database and the EER model.
According to the data format at: https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/books
the 'bib_key' can use many different identifiers as keys to look up books, so 
currently this uses the 'isbn_10' identifier as primary key to keep things simple, which
can be coded to be used by the bib_key.  Feel free to edit as required.
